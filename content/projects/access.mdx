This repository contains a collection of my machine learning projects, showcasing both research and industry-based projects. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment.

- Fully typed
- Zero dependencies
- Serializable to store in a database


## Project 1: Google Stock Prediction

**Description:**

- Features:
- Dataset: kaggle
- Notebooks: jupyter_notebook





## Install

```To run the projects locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/darkandpure/machine-learning-projects.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```Navigate to the project directory you are interested in: cd machine-learning-projects/[project-name]

Open the Jupyter notebook or execute the Python script:
- Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook [notebook-name].ipynb`
- Python script: `python [script-name].py`
